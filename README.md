# U.S.-Border-Crossings
An exploratory analysis of U.S. Border crossings

# Objective
The objective of this project is to take a closer look at where people are crossing the U.S. borders, how they are crossing, and when they are crossing.  The project was used to look for possible patterns and to ascertain which crossing points have the highest volume, and by which method of crossing.

# Tools
Python
Excel
Tableau
Google Drive

# Data Set
The data set “Border_Crossing_entry_Data.csv” was provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and provides information on inbound crossings at the US-Canada and US-Mexico border.  It includes data for trucks, trains, containers, buses, personal vehicles, passengers, and pedestrians. The data was collected at US ports of entry by US Customs and Borders Protection (CBP) and can be downloaded from Data.gov.
